A Project that was made by me (When I was working at Provik) for an exhibition event. 
The concept was to develop a "machine" which consisted of two 6-Axis Epson Robots (PC Monitors attached),
to go to specific positions based on user/visitor input (Button Press) and play a video.

The video was not selected randomly, but based on the button it was pressed. Moreover, all the events and states of the machine were recorded into a database, 
both for R&D and for demonstration purposes. The UI consisted of 3 pages, one for each robot and one admin dashboard.

The technologies used for this project are displayed below:

1) C# (Script for PC-PLC Communication)
2) Python (Script for starting all communication scripts, server, client app)
3) MySQL (Database)
4) Typescript (Frontend)
5) React.JS (Frontend)
6) Node.JS (Backend)
7) Siemens Tia Portal V16 (PLC)
8) Epson RC+ 7.0
