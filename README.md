A Project that was made by me (When I was working at Provik) for an exhibition event. 
The concept was to develop a "machine" which consisted of two 6-Axis Epson Robots (PC Monitors attached),
to go to specific positions based on user/visitor input (Button Press) and play a video.

The video was not selected randomly, but based on the button it was pressed. Moreover, all the events and states of the machine were recorded into a database, 
both for R&D and for demonstration purposes. The UI consisted of 3 pages, one for each robot and one admin dashboard.

The technologies used for this project are displayed below:

1) C# (Script for PC-PLC Communication)
2) MySQL (Database)
3) Typescript (Frontend)
4) React.JS (Frontend)
5) Node.JS (Backend)
6) Siemens Tia Portal V16
7) Epson RC+ 7.0
